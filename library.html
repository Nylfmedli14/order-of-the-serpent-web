            <p>""...let us walk in the gloom of the pyramids, in the cool shadows of ruined temples, aye, through the tortuous labyrinth of the Egyptian mind itself, trusting that by virtue of the light we carry we shall succeed in unravelling to some extent the age-long enigma of this mystic land." - from Chapter 1.</p>

            <h4>Aleister Crowley</h4>
            <p>A good book for giving the basics on meditation as well as ceremonial magic. Very traditional and Solar based, but worth the read, especially Part I.</p>

            <h4>Michael W. Ford</h4>
            <p>Ford writes a great many things, but this stands out with its use of an Ahriman based Left Hand Path system out of Persia. This is a very unique view thus far in the modern LHP, and is worth looking into. The rituals are quite bizarre in a positive way, but beware of the editing mistakes throughout.</p>

            <p>A must read for anyone even slightly interested in the Western Esoteric Tradition. It cannot be overstated how fundamental this text is to understanding much of esoteric thought in the 20th and 21st century.</p>

            <p>There is a of historical information on Set, Naqada, early writing and cultural development, etc. Covers in depth the religious burial practices of Egypt before it was even truly Egypt, and traces the Cult of Set far into pre-history.</p>

            <h4>Phil Hine</h4>
            <p>Magic is about change. Magic leads us into exhilaration and ecstasy; into insight and understanding; into changing ourselves and the world in which we participate. Through Magic we may come to explore the possibilities of Freedom, real world change, and dynamic Self-transformation.</p>

            <h3 id="Cthulhu Mythos Encyclopedia">Cthulhu Mythos Encyclopedia</h3>
            <h4>Daniel Harms</h4>
            <p>A very thorough encyclopedia on the beings of Lovecraft and those who continued his work. Great for those inspired by Cosmic Horror and Weird Fiction, as well as the Dreamworld tales.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Dark Lord, The">Dark Lord, The</h3>
            <h4>Peter Levenda</h4>
            <p>A thorough look into the works and ideas of Kenneth Grant and his Typhonian Tradition. Grant is extremely hard to read most of the time, and this text is of great - if sometimes awkward - depth. Also contains one of the most fascinating looks at The Book of the Law and what is contained within. Delves into the early Egyptian Setian ideology and stellar symbolism.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Devil's Party, The">Devil's Party, The</h3>
            <h4>Per Faxneld and Jesper Aa. Petersen</h4>
            <p>A fantastic academic work, and each article is from a different author, lending a wider perspective. Part one covers early Satanism in Scandinavia. The next parts discuss LaVey, the Church of Satan, and has about six chapters dedicated to these topics. The final part of the book discusses Setianism, Luciferianism, and the Sinister Tradition.</p>

            <h4>J. S. Gordon</h4>
            <p> Overwhelming, and at times rather questionable as a factual work, this is nonetheless and interesting look at how the Egyptians viewed the starry night sky all religions arose from.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 id="Fire and Ice">Fire and Ice</h3>
            <h4>Dr. Stephen E. Flowers</h4>
            <p>This text is likely the most thorough, English work on the Brotherhood of Saturn. This German order mixed the Thelema of Crowley with a darker, Luciferian usage of the symbolism of Saturn.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 id="Gods of the Egyptians, The">Gods of the Egyptians, The</h3>
            <h4>E.A. Wallis Budge</h4>
            <p>By far the most useful book covering the gods of ancient Egypt is this book by Dr. Budge of the British Museum, one of the foremost Egyptologists of the 20th century.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Gödel’s Proof">Gödel’s Proof</h3>
            <h4>Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman</h4>
            <p>A full, indepth look at Godel’s philosophy of mathematics, its implications, and an explanation for how it all works. Even though this is intended for all to read, it is extraordinarily dense unless one has a grasp of both mathematics and logic.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 id="Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, The">Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, The</h3>
            <h4>Godwin, Chanel, and Deveney</h4>
            <p>Before the Typhonian Tradition, before Thelema, before Theosophy, there was the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Rarely known about in most occult circles, this work contains thorough background information, internal letters, rituals, literally everything you could ever want from the order that started it all.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Hermetic Magic: The Postmodern Magical Papyrus of Abaris">Hermetic Magic: The Postmodern Magical Papyrus of Abaris</h3>
            <h4>Dr. Stephen Edred Flowers.</h4>
            <p>The technical formulas of the Hermetic tradition of magic have been well documented, but they are barely known to the community of modern magicians. Authentic Hermetic formulas concealed in the magical papyri of Egypt have great potency, representing the first known attempt to forge many traditions of magic into a unified system. In Hermetic Magic, Flowers reveals the secrets of this "down-to-earth" form of magic that originated some 1500 to 2000 years ago.</p>

            <h3 id="History of the Devil and the Idea of Evil">History of the Devil and the Idea of Evil</h3>
            <h4>Paul Carus</h4>
            <p>This book is dated and biased, but it is a very interesting read into how The Devil evolved over time. The reader must be cautious of Carus' outdated views and ideas, but in the end the vigilant reader should thoroughly enjoy it.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Images of Set">Images of Set</h3>
            <h4>Joan Ann Lansberry</h4>
            <p>A massive collection of images of Set, along with background information on those images. Beautiful and enlightening.</p>

            <h3 id="In Pursuit of Satan: the Police and the Occult">In Pursuit of Satan: the Police and the Occult</h3>
            <h4>Robert D. Hicks</h4>
            <p>Outdated, being from 1991, this book is a VERY in-depth look into how the police were treating Satanism and crime during the Satanic Panic. Almost an overwhelming amount of information, it looks at the Panic from pretty much each factor that was relevant to the occurrence. Zeena LaVey actually worked with Hicks on the writing of this book.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Invention of Satanism, The">Invention of Satanism, The</h3>
            <h4>Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen</h4>
            <p>This book, and its amazing authors, have filled the much needed role of providing unbiased, outsider, academic information into Satanism. This text contains statistics from three repeated surveys on every facet of Satanism imaginable. It looks into the history of modern Satanism, works to define it objectively, and give a clear view of the various forms of Satanism.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 id="Justice">Justice</h3>
            <h4>Michael Sandel</h4>
            <p>One of the best philosophers of justice to ever live discusses most common justice systems at level that, while deep and thorough, can be understood by any interested reader.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="King in Yellow, The">King in Yellow, The</h3>
            <h4>Robert W. Chambers</h4>
            <p>Or more specifically, the first four stories of Chamber's classic work. A work of early, pre-Lovecraftian weird fiction, the King in Yellow tells an esoteric tale about a cursed play, and a King beyond comprehension.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="Lords of the Left Hand Path">Lords of the Left Hand Path</h3>
            <h4>Dr. Stephen E. Flowers</h4>
            <p>This book is one of the few, if not only, works that cover the Left Hand Path from is pre-historic birth to modern day. While many of the early chapters are disappointingly short, the book makes up for it in its discussion of the modern LHP.</p>

            <p>Imagine sitting at a reading of the Iliad, seeing a play at the Globe, or attending a ceremony in an Ancient Egyptian temple. This is the modern version, a perfect take on ancient mythology. Widely hated for its "Christian symbolism," those familiar with esotericism will be well aware that solar ideology goes far beyond Christ. Man vs. God, ascension, ancient superhuman beings, Batman v. Superman is one of the finest movies the lover of mythology could ever hope to see.</p>

            <p>Ironically J.R.R. Tolkien was catholic, and the symbolism exists throughout LotR. But a story of men rising above a God-like being, who rules mindless sheep with an iron fist, cannot help but be compared to Luciferian ideology.
