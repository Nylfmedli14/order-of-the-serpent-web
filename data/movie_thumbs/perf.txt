-n ... number ..... number of perforations; integer>0; default=8
-s ... size ....... size of perforations as percentage of smaller image 
................... dimension; 0<float<=15; default=6
-p ... position ... position of perforations; choices are: TB (for top/bottom
................... edges or LR (for left/right edges); default is along the 
................... edges corresponding to the larger image dimension
-b ... border ..... border type; choices are: black, burned, faded or none;
................... default=black

PURPOSE: To apply film-like perforations to two opposite edges of an image.

DESCRIPTION: PERFORATIONS applies film-like perforations to two opposite edges of an image. Various border types may be selected.

ARGUMENTS:

-n number ... NUMBER of perforations. Values are integers>0. The default=8.

-s size ... SIZE of perforations as percentage of smaller image dimension. Values are 0<floats<=15. The default=6.

-p position POSITION of perforations. The choices are: TB (for top/bottom edges or LR (for left/right edges). The default is along the edges corresponding to the larger image dimension.

-b border ... BORDER type. The choices are: black (b), aged (a), faded (f) or none (n). The default=black. Note: border=faded fades to transparent.

Requirements: IM 6.5.9.3 or higher due to the use of 1D morphology blur for border=aged or faded.
